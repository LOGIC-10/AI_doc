# ü§ó Introduction

RepoAgent is an Open-Source project driven by Large Language Models(LLMs) that aims to provide an intelligent way to document projects. 
It is designed to be a handy tool for developers who need to organize their code and cooperate with teammates.

## üëæ Background
In the realm of computer programming, the significance of comprehensive project documentation, including detailed explanations for each Python file, cannot be overstated. Such documentation serves as the cornerstone for understanding, maintaining, and enhancing the codebase. It provides essential context and rationale for the code, making it easier for current and future developers to comprehend the purpose, functionality, and structure of the software. It not only facilitates current and future developers in grasping the project's purpose and structure but also ensures that the project remains accessible and modifiable over time, significantly easing the learning curve for new team members.

Traditionally, creating and maintaining software documentation demanded significant human effort and expertise, a challenge for small teams without dedicated personnel. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT has transformed this, enabling AI to handle much of the documentation process. This shift allows human developers to focus on verification and fine-tuning, greatly reducing the manual burden of documentation.

**üèÜ Our goal is to create an intelligent document assistant that helps people read and understand repositories and generate documents, ultimately helping people improve efficiency and save time.**

## ‚ú® Features

- **ü§ñ Automatically detects changes in Git repositories, tracking additions, deletions, and modifications of files.**
- **üìù Independently analyzes the code structure through AST, generating documents for individual objects.**
- **üîç Accurate identification of inter-object bidirectional invocation relationships, enriching the global perspective of document content.**
- **üìö Seamlessly replaces Markdown content based on changes, maintaining consistency in documentation.**
- **üïô Executes multi-threaded concurrent operations, enhancing the efficiency of document generation.**
- **üë≠ Offer a sustainable, automated documentation update method for team collaboration.**
- **üòç Display Code Documentation in an amazing way. (with document book per project powered by Gitbook)**


## üöÄ Getting Started

    - Install dependencies using PDM
    
      ```bash
       pdm install
      ```

### Configuring RepoAgent

First, configure the OpenAI API parameters in the config.yml file.
For details on obtaining these, please refer to [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/developer-quickstart/your-api-keys).

In the `config.yml` file, configure other parameters like OpenAI API, the destination repository path, document language, and so on:

```yaml
api_keys:
  gpt-3.5-turbo-16k:
    - api_key: sk-XXXX
      base_url: https://example.com/v1/
      api_type: azure
      api_version: XXX
      engine: GPT-35-Turbo-16k
      # you can use any kwargs supported by openai.ChatCompletion here
    - api_key: sk-xxxxx
      organization: org-xxxxxx
      model: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
  ...

default_completion_kwargs:
  model: gpt-4-1106
  temperature: 0.2
  request_timeout: 60

repo_path: /path/to/your/repo
project_hierarchy: .project_hierarchy # This is a folder, where we store the project hierarchy and metainfo. This can be shared with your team members.
Markdown_Docs_folder: Markdown_Docs # The folder in the root directory of your target repository to store the documentation.
ignore_list: ["ignore_file1.py", "ignore_file2.py", "ignore_directory"] # Ignore some py files or folders that you don't want to generate documentation for by giving relative paths in ignore_list.
whitelist_path: /path/of/whitelist_path_json #if you provide the whitelist json with the same structure in Metainfo, RepoAgent will only process the given part. This is useful in a very big project, like "higgingface Transformers"

language: en # Two-letter language codes (ISO 639-1 codes), e.g. `language: en` for English. Refer to Supported Language for more languages.
max_thread_count: 10 # We support multiprocessing to speedup the process
max_document_tokens: 1024 # the maximum number of tokens in a document generated 
log_level: info
```

### Run RepoAgent

Enter the root directory of RepoAgent and type the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python -m repo_agent
```

If it's your first time generating documentation for the target repository, RepoAgent will automatically create a JSON file maintaining the global structure information and a folder named Markdown_Docs in the root directory of the target repository for storing documents.

The paths of the global structure information json file and the documentation folder can be configured in `config.yml`.

Once you have initially generated the global documentation for the target repository, or if the project you cloned already contains global documentation information, you can then seamlessly and automatically maintain internal project documentation with your team by configuring the **pre-commit hook** in the target repository!


### Configuring the Target Repository

RepoAgent currently supports generating documentation for projects, which requires some configuration in the target repository.

First, ensure that the target repository is a git repository and has been initialized.
```
git init
```
Install pre-commit in the target repository to detect changes in the git repository.

```
pip install pre-commit
```
Create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root directory of the target repository. An example is as follows:

```
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
    - id: repo-agent
      name: RepoAgent
      entry: python path/to/your/repo_agent/runner.py
      language: system
      # You can specify the file types that trigger the hook, but currently only python is supported.
      types: [python]
```
For specific configuration methods of hooks, please refer to [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#plugins).
After configuring the yaml file, execute the following command to install the hook.
```
pre-commit install
```
In this way, each git commit will trigger the RepoAgent's hook, automatically detecting changes in the target repository and generating corresponding documents.
Next, you can make some modifications to the target repository, such as adding a new file to the target repository, or modifying an existing file.
You just need to follow the normal git workflow: git add, git commit -m "your commit message", git push
The RepoAgent hook will automatically trigger at git commit, detect the files you added in the previous step, and generate corresponding documents.

After execution, RepoAgent will automatically modify the staged files in the target repository and formally submit the commit. After the execution is completed, the green "Passed" will be displayed, as shown in the figure below:
![Execution Result](assets/images/ExecutionResult.png)

The generated document will be stored in the specified folder in the root directory of the target warehouse. The rendering of the generated document is as shown below:
![Documentation](assets/images/Doc_example.png)
![Documentation](assets/images/8_documents.png)

We utilized the default model **gpt-3.5-turbo** to generate documentation for the [**XAgent**](https://github.com/OpenBMB/XAgent) project, which comprises approximately **270,000 lines** of code. You can view the results of this generation in the Markdown_Docs directory of the XAgent project on GitHub. For enhanced documentation quality, we suggest considering more advanced models like **gpt-4-1106** or **gpt-4-0125-preview**.

**In the end, you can flexibly adjust the output format, template, and other aspects of the document by customizing the prompt. We are excited about your exploration of a more scientific approach to Automated Technical Writing and your contributions to the community.** 

### Exploring chat with repo
We conceptualize **Chat With Repo** as a unified gateway for these downstream applications, acting as a connector that links RepoAgent to human users and other AI agents. Our future research will focus on adapting the interface to various downstream applications and customizing it to meet their unique characteristics and implementation requirements.

Here we demonstrate a preliminary prototype of one of our downstream tasks: Automatic Q&A for Issues and Code Explanation. You can start the server by running the following code.
```bash
python -m repo_agent.chat_with_repo
```
