## ClassDef FileHandler
**FileHandler**: The function of FileHandler is to manage file operations related to a repository, including reading, writing, and analyzing file content, as well as generating file and repository structures for documentation purposes.

**Attributes**:
- `file_path`: The relative path of the file within the repository.
- `repo_path`: The path to the root of the repository.
- `project_hierarchy`: The path to the project hierarchy JSON file, which is used to store the structure of the project.

**Code Description**:
The FileHandler class is designed to facilitate various file operations within a software repository. It provides functionalities such as reading the content of files, writing content to files, extracting code information, and generating documentation structures based on the code.

- The `read_file` method reads the content of the file specified by `file_path` and returns it as a string.
- The `get_obj_code_info` method extracts information about a code object, such as a function or class, from a file. It returns a dictionary containing details like the type of the code object, its name, start and end line numbers, parameters, and whether it contains a return statement.
- The `write_file` method writes a given content to a specified file path within the repository. It ensures the creation of necessary directories.
- The `get_modified_file_versions` method retrieves the current and previous versions of a modified file, aiding in the analysis of changes.
- The `get_end_lineno` method calculates the end line number of a code object, which is useful for documentation and analysis purposes.
- The `add_parent_references` method enriches the abstract syntax tree (AST) by adding parent references to each node, facilitating hierarchical analysis of code objects.
- The `get_functions_and_classes` method parses the content of a file to identify and list all functions and classes, including their parameters and hierarchical relationships.
- The `generate_file_structure` method generates a structured representation of the functions and classes within a file, which can be used for documentation.
- The `generate_overall_structure` method compiles the structures of all files within the repository that are not ignored by `.gitignore` or specified to be jumped over. It is crucial for generating comprehensive documentation of the repository.
- The `convert_to_markdown_file` method converts the structured representation of a file into markdown format, which is ready for documentation purposes.

This class is utilized in various parts of the project to handle file-related operations, especially in the context of generating and updating documentation. For instance, it is used to initialize meta information about the repository, process file changes, and generate documentation for individual code objects. Its functionalities support the automated generation of documentation by analyzing the codebase, identifying changes, and structuring the information in a human-readable format.

**Note**:
- It is important to ensure that the `repo_path` and `file_path` are correctly set to reflect the actual structure of the repository.
- The methods that parse and analyze code (like `get_functions_and_classes`) rely on the Python AST module, which means they are primarily designed to work with Python source files.

**Output Example**:
An example output of the `get_obj_code_info` method might look like this:
```python
{
    'type': 'FunctionDef',
    'name': 'my_function',
    'md_content': [],
    'code_start_line': 10,
    'code_end_line': 20,
    'params': ['param1', 'param2'],
    'have_return': True,
    'code_content': 'def my_function(param1, param2):\n    return param1 + param2',
    'name_column': 4
}
```
This dictionary contains detailed information about a function named `my_function`, including its type, name, start and end line numbers, parameters, and its content.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, repo_path, file_path)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a FileHandler object with specific repository and file paths, and to set up the path for the project hierarchy configuration file.

**Parameters**:
- **repo_path**: The path to the root directory of the repository. This is the base path where the repository resides on the filesystem.
- **file_path**: The path to a specific file within the repository. This path is relative to the repository's root directory.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` method is a constructor for the `FileHandler` class. It takes two arguments: `repo_path` and `file_path`. These parameters are essential for setting up the FileHandler object to work with files within a specific repository.

- `self.file_path` is assigned the value of `file_path`, which represents the path to a file relative to the root of the repository. This path is used by other methods of the `FileHandler` class to access or manipulate the specified file.
- `self.repo_path` is assigned the value of `repo_path`, which is the absolute path to the root directory of the repository. This path is crucial for constructing absolute paths to files and directories within the repository.
- `self.project_hierarchy` is constructed using `os.path.join` to concatenate `repo_path`, a configuration value `CONFIG["project_hierarchy"]`, and the filename `"project_hierarchy.json"`. This results in the absolute path to a JSON file that presumably contains information about the project's hierarchical structure. The `CONFIG` variable is assumed to be a global or otherwise accessible dictionary that contains configuration settings for the project, including the relative path to where project hierarchy information is stored.

**Note**:
- It is important to ensure that `repo_path` is an absolute path to avoid any ambiguity or errors when accessing files within the repository.
- The `file_path` should be carefully provided relative to the repository's root directory to ensure correct file access and manipulation.
- The `CONFIG` dictionary must be properly configured and accessible within the scope of this method, specifically containing a valid path under the key `"project_hierarchy"`, for the `self.project_hierarchy` attribute to be correctly set up. This configuration is essential for the `FileHandler` to locate and interact with the project hierarchy information.
***
### FunctionDef read_file(self)
**read_file**: The function of read_file is to read and return the content of a file associated with the FileHandler instance.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters apart from the implicit `self` parameter, which represents the instance of the `FileHandler` class through which the function is called.

**Code Description**: The `read_file` function is a crucial component of the FileHandler class, designed to handle the reading of file contents within a repository. It constructs an absolute file path by combining the repository path (`repo_path`) and the relative file path (`file_path`) stored within the FileHandler instance. The function then opens the file in read mode with UTF-8 encoding to ensure compatibility with a wide range of text formats and reads its entire content into a string. Finally, it returns this string to the caller.

This function plays a significant role in the project, particularly in scenarios where file contents need to be processed or analyzed. For instance, in the `Runner` class's `add_new_item` method, `read_file` is used to retrieve the content of a newly added file so that its structure can be analyzed and documented. Similarly, in the `process_file_changes` method, it is employed to fetch the content of files that have been modified, allowing the system to identify structural changes and update documentation accordingly. These use cases underscore the function's importance in enabling dynamic documentation generation and update processes based on file content within the project.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `repo_path` and `file_path` attributes of the FileHandler instance are correctly set before calling `read_file`. The function assumes these paths are valid and will raise an error if the constructed file path does not exist or is inaccessible.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the file located at the constructed absolute file path contains the text "Hello, world!", the `read_file` function would return:
```
"Hello, world!"
```
***
### FunctionDef get_obj_code_info(self, code_type, code_name, start_line, end_line, params, file_path)
**get_obj_code_info**: The function of `get_obj_code_info` is to retrieve and compile detailed information about a specific segment of code within a file.

**Parameters**:
- `code_type` (str): Specifies the type of the code (e.g., function, class).
- `code_name` (str): The name identifier of the code segment.
- `start_line` (int): The line number where the code segment begins.
- `end_line` (int): The line number where the code segment ends.
- `params` (str): Parameters associated with the code segment.
- `file_path` (str, optional): The path to the file containing the code. If not provided, a default path associated with the `FileHandler` instance is used.

**Code Description**:
The `get_obj_code_info` function is designed to extract and organize information about a code segment, identified by its start and end lines within a file. This function is a critical component of the `FileHandler` class, facilitating the analysis and documentation of code structures within a repository.

Upon invocation, the function initializes a dictionary to store the code information, including its type, name, parameters, and line numbers. It then reads the file, either from a specified path or a default path, and extracts the code segment's content. Additionally, it identifies the column position of the code name in its first line and checks for the presence of a return statement within the code segment.

The function encapsulates this information in a dictionary, which includes the type, name, starting and ending line numbers, parameters, presence of a return statement, the actual code content, and the column position of the code name. This structured information is crucial for generating documentation and analyzing the code's structure and behavior.

**Relationship with Callers**:
- In the `generate_file_structure` method of the `FileHandler` class, `get_obj_code_info` is used to gather information about each code segment identified within a file. This information is then compiled into a list that represents the file's structure, aiding in the documentation process.
- The `add_new_item` method in the `Runner` class utilizes `get_obj_code_info` to extract information about code segments for new projects. This information is used to generate documentation and update project structure information stored in JSON format.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the file containing the code segment is accessible from the provided or default file path.
- The line numbers (`start_line` and `end_line`) are inclusive and should accurately reflect the code segment's boundaries.
- The function does not perform syntax or semantic analysis of the code content; it primarily focuses on structural and basic behavioral aspects (e.g., presence of a return statement).

**Output Example**:
```python
{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "example_function",
    "md_content": [],
    "code_start_line": 10,
    "code_end_line": 20,
    "params": "param1, param2",
    "have_return": True,
    "code_content": "def example_function(param1, param2):\n    return param1 + param2",
    "name_column": 4
}
```
This example output represents the information dictionary for a hypothetical function `example_function`, detailing its structure and content within a file.
***
### FunctionDef write_file(self, file_path, content)
**write_file**: The function of write_file is to write content to a file at a specified path.

**Parameters**:
- **file_path** (str): The relative path of the file where the content will be written.
- **content** (str): The content to be written to the file.

**Code Description**: 
The `write_file` function is designed to facilitate the writing of content to a file within a repository. It first checks if the provided `file_path` is an absolute path (i.e., starts with "/"). If it is, the leading "/" is removed to ensure the path is relative. This is crucial because the function constructs an absolute path by joining the `file_path` with a base path stored in `self.repo_path`, which represents the root directory of the repository.

After constructing the absolute file path, the function ensures that the directory structure needed to accommodate the file exists. This is done using `os.makedirs`, with `exist_ok=True` to avoid raising an error if the directory already exists. Finally, the content is written to the file using `open` with write ("w") mode and specifying UTF-8 encoding to support a wide range of characters.

This function plays a critical role in the project's file management system, particularly in the context of generating and updating documentation. It is called in two scenarios within the project:
1. **Adding New Items**: When new projects are added to the JSON file and corresponding documentation needs to be generated, `write_file` is used to write markdown content to documentation files. This process involves generating documentation for all objects within a new file and updating the project's JSON structure to reflect these additions.
2. **Processing File Changes**: When changes are detected in existing files, `write_file` is employed to update the markdown documentation corresponding to these files. This ensures that the project's documentation remains in sync with the codebase, reflecting any additions, deletions, or modifications to the code structures.

**Note**: 
- It is important to ensure that the `file_path` provided does not lead to unintended directory traversal. The function assumes that the path is relative to `self.repo_path`, and any leading "/" is removed to enforce this assumption.
- The function overwrites the content of the file if it already exists. Care should be taken to avoid accidental data loss, especially when updating existing files.
***
### FunctionDef get_modified_file_versions(self)
**get_modified_file_versions**: The function retrieves the current and previous versions of a modified file within a repository.

**Parameters**: This function does not accept any parameters directly as it is designed to be called on an instance of the FileHandler class, which should have `repo_path` and `file_path` attributes already set.

**Code Description**: The `get_modified_file_versions` function is a crucial component of the FileHandler class, designed to interact with a Git repository to fetch the current and previous versions of a specified file. It first initializes a Git repository object using the `repo_path` attribute of the FileHandler instance. This repository object is then used to perform operations related to Git.

The function proceeds to read the current version of the file directly from the working directory using the `file_path` attribute. It opens the file in read mode, ensuring it reads text by specifying the encoding as "utf-8", and stores the content in `current_version`.

To obtain the previous version of the file, the function retrieves the last commit affecting the specified file using the `iter_commits` method of the repository object, limited to the most recent commit (`max_count=1`) that modified the specified file path. If such a commit exists, it attempts to read the file's content from this commit. If the file does not exist in the commit (indicating it might be a new addition), `previous_version` is set to None, acknowledging that there is no previous version available.

This function is integral to tracking changes in files within a Git repository, especially for applications that need to analyze or process these changes, such as determining new or deleted objects in the file across versions.

In the context of its calling situation within the project, specifically by the `get_new_objects` method in `runner.py`, `get_modified_file_versions` provides the necessary data to compare the current and previous versions of a Python file. This comparison is used to identify new and deleted objects (functions or classes) by parsing the content of these versions, highlighting its importance in enabling version-based analysis and processing within the project.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the FileHandler instance calling this function has valid `repo_path` and `file_path` attributes that correctly point to the Git repository and the file of interest, respectively. Additionally, the function assumes that the file exists in the current working directory of the repository and that the repository's history is accessible for retrieving the previous version.

**Output Example**:
```python
("<current version content>", "<previous version content>")
```
In this example, the first element of the tuple is a string containing the entire content of the file as it currently exists in the working directory, and the second element is a string containing the content of the file from the last commit in which it was modified, or `None` if the file was not present in the last commit.
***
### FunctionDef get_end_lineno(self, node)
**get_end_lineno**: The function of `get_end_lineno` is to determine the ending line number of a specified node within a file.

**Parameters**:
- **node**: The node for which the end line number is to be found. This node is expected to be part of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the structure of Python code.

**Code Description**:
The `get_end_lineno` function plays a crucial role in analyzing Python code by providing the ability to find the end line number of a given node within an AST. This is particularly useful when dealing with nodes that represent constructs such as functions, classes, or any block of code that spans multiple lines.

The function starts by checking if the provided node has the attribute `lineno`, which is a standard attribute in AST nodes representing the starting line number. If the node does not have this attribute, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the end line number could not be determined.

If the node has a `lineno` attribute, the function initializes `end_lineno` with this value. It then iterates over all child nodes of the given node using `ast.iter_child_nodes(node)`. For each child node, it attempts to find the child's end line number. This is done by first trying to directly access the `end_lineno` attribute of the child. If this attribute is not present, the function recursively calls itself with the child node as the argument to determine the child's end line number.

During the iteration, if a child node has a valid end line number (`child_end > -1`), the function updates `end_lineno` to be the maximum of the current `end_lineno` and the child's end line number. This ensures that `end_lineno` represents the furthest line number reached by the node or any of its descendants.

This function is utilized within the project, specifically in the `get_functions_and_classes` method of the `FileHandler` class. In that context, `get_end_lineno` is used to determine the ending line numbers of functions and classes within a Python file. This information, along with the starting line number, name, and parameters of the functions and classes, is compiled into a list of tuples. This list serves as a comprehensive overview of the code structure, facilitating further analysis or manipulation of the code content.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the input `node` is part of an AST generated by the `ast` module. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the node is correctly parsed and represents a valid structure within Python code before calling this function.
- The function's ability to accurately determine the end line number depends on the presence of `lineno` and `end_lineno` attributes in the AST nodes. These attributes are typically available in AST nodes generated for Python code but may vary based on the Python version and the specifics of the AST generation process.

**Output Example**:
If the function is called with a node representing a Python function that starts on line 10 and ends on line 20, the function would return `20`. If the node does not have a line number, the function would return `-1`.
***
### FunctionDef add_parent_references(self, node, parent)
**add_parent_references**: The function of add_parent_references is to recursively add a parent reference to each node in an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

**Parameters**:
- **node**: The current node in the AST being processed.
- **parent** (Optional): The parent node of the current node. Defaults to None if the current node is the root of the AST.

**Code Description**:
The `add_parent_references` function is a crucial component within the `FileHandler` class, designed to enhance the AST by adding parent references to each node. This augmentation allows for backward navigation within the tree, which is not natively supported by the AST structure provided by Python's `ast` module.

The function operates recursively, starting from a given node (typically the root of the AST) and traversing through all its child nodes. For each child node encountered, the function assigns the current node as its parent (`child.parent = node`) and then calls itself with the child node as the new current node and the current node as the new parent. This process continues until all nodes in the AST have been processed and have had parent references added to them.

This function is particularly useful in scenarios where understanding the hierarchical relationship between nodes is necessary. For example, in the context of the `get_functions_and_classes` method within the same `FileHandler` class, `add_parent_references` is invoked to preprocess the AST. This preprocessing step is critical for enabling the subsequent extraction of functions, classes, and their relationships, including hierarchical ones, from the code content being analyzed. By having parent references available, it becomes feasible to navigate the AST in both directions (towards the children and towards the parent), thereby facilitating more complex analyses such as determining the scope of variables or understanding the nesting of functions and classes.

**Note**:
- It is important to ensure that the AST passed to this function is correctly formed and represents the structure of the code accurately. Malformed ASTs could lead to incorrect parent references being added or the function failing to process the tree entirely.
- The function modifies the AST in-place by adding parent references to the nodes. Therefore, if the original AST is needed for other purposes without these modifications, it should be cloned before passing it to this function.
- This function does not return any value as it modifies the AST in-place.
***
### FunctionDef get_functions_and_classes(self, code_content)
**get_functions_and_classes**: The function of get_functions_and_classes is to retrieve all functions and classes from a given code content, along with their parameters (if any), and their hierarchical relationships.

**Parameters**:
- **code_content**: The code content of the whole file to be parsed. This is a string containing the source code from which functions and classes are to be extracted.

**Code Description**:
The `get_functions_and_classes` function is designed to parse Python code content and extract a comprehensive list of functions and classes defined within. It utilizes the `ast` module to parse the given code content into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Before extracting functions and classes, it calls `add_parent_references` to enhance the AST by adding parent references to each node, enabling the identification of hierarchical relationships between nodes.

The function iterates over all nodes in the AST using `ast.walk`, filtering for nodes that are instances of `ast.FunctionDef`, `ast.ClassDef`, or `ast.AsyncFunctionDef`. For each of these nodes, it determines the starting line number directly from the node's `lineno` attribute. The ending line number is obtained by calling the `get_end_lineno` method, which recursively finds the maximum line number reached by the node or any of its descendants.

Parameters of functions are extracted by iterating over `node.args.args` and collecting the `arg` attribute of each parameter. The function compiles a list of tuples, each representing a function or class. Each tuple contains the type of the node (`FunctionDef`, `ClassDef`, `AsyncFunctionDef`), the name of the node, the starting line number, the ending line number, and a list of parameters.

**Note**:
- The function assumes the input `code_content` is valid Python code. Invalid or syntactically incorrect code may lead to parsing errors.
- The hierarchical relationships are determined based on the AST structure. However, this version of the function does not include the parent node's name in the output tuples due to commented-out sections of the code that would otherwise perform this task.
- The function modifies the AST in-place by adding parent references. If the original AST is needed for other purposes without these modifications, it should be cloned before passing it to this function.

**Output Example**:
An example output of this function could look like this:
```python
[
    ('FunctionDef', 'my_function', 10, 20, ['param1', 'param2']),
    ('ClassDef', 'MyClass', 22, 30, []),
    ('FunctionDef', 'another_function', 32, 40, ['arg1'])
]
```
This output indicates that the code contains a function named `my_function` starting at line 10 and ending at line 20 with two parameters, a class named `MyClass` between lines 22 and 30 with no parameters, and another function named `another_function` from line 32 to 40 with one parameter.
***
### FunctionDef generate_file_structure(self, file_path)
**generate_file_structure**: The function of `generate_file_structure` is to generate the file structure for a given file path.

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (str): The relative path of the file for which the structure is to be generated.

**Code Description**:
The `generate_file_structure` function is a method of the `FileHandler` class designed to analyze a file's content and extract its structural components, such as functions and classes, including their details like type, name, start and end lines, and parameters. It operates by reading the content of a file located at a specified path relative to the repository's root directory. This is achieved by combining the repository path stored in `self.repo_path` with the provided `file_path`.

Upon reading the file, the method utilizes another function, `get_functions_and_classes`, to parse the file's content and identify all functions and classes within it. This parsing process results in a list of structures, where each structure contains information about a specific code segment, such as its type (function or class), name, start line, end line, and parameters.

For each identified structure, the method calls `get_obj_code_info`, which further processes each structure to compile detailed information, including the code segment's content and additional metadata like the presence of a return statement and the column position of the code name. This information is compiled into a dictionary for each code segment.

The method returns a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing the detailed information of a code segment within the file. This list serves as a comprehensive representation of the file's structure, aiding in documentation and analysis tasks.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the file exists at the given path relative to the repository's root directory. If the file does not exist, an error will occur.
- The function relies on accurate parsing of the file's content. Therefore, the file content should be valid Python code for the parsing to be successful.
- The detailed information generated by this function is crucial for documentation purposes and for understanding the structure and components of the file.

**Output Example**:
An example output of this function could be a list of dictionaries, each representing a function or class within the file:
```python
[
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "example_function",
        "start_line": 10,
        "end_line": 20,
        "params": ["param1", "param2"],
        "code_content": "def example_function(param1, param2):\n    return param1 + param2",
        "parent": "class_name"
    },
    {
        "type": "class",
        "name": "ExampleClass",
        "start_line": 5,
        "end_line": 25,
        "params": [],
        "code_content": "class ExampleClass:\n    def example_method(self):\n        pass",
        "parent": None
    }
]
```
This output indicates that the file contains a function named `example_function` with parameters `param1` and `param2`, and a class named `ExampleClass`. Each dictionary includes the type, name, start and end lines, parameters, and the actual code content of the code segment.
***
### FunctionDef generate_overall_structure(self, file_path_reflections, jump_files)
**generate_overall_structure**: The function of `generate_overall_structure` is to obtain the file structure of a target repository by walking through its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and identifying all objects, while excluding files specified in `jump_files`.

**Parameters**:
- `file_path_reflections` (dict): A mapping of file paths that may include "fake" file paths used for reflection in the repository's structure.
- `jump_files` (list): A list of file paths that should not be parsed and are to be treated as non-existent.

**Code Description**:
The `generate_overall_structure` function is a method within the `FileHandler` class designed to analyze a repository's file structure, excluding files specified in `jump_files`. It initializes a `GitignoreChecker` instance with the repository path and its `.gitignore` file to filter out files that should be ignored according to the `.gitignore` rules.

The function iterates over the files in the repository that are not ignored by `.gitignore`, as determined by the `GitignoreChecker`. During the iteration, it checks if a file is in `jump_files` or ends with a specific substring indicating it is the latest version and should be skipped. If a file meets these conditions, it is ignored, and a message is printed to indicate this action.

For each file that is not ignored, the function attempts to generate its file structure using the `generate_file_structure` method of the `FileHandler` class. This method analyzes the file's content to extract its structural components, such as functions and classes. If an error occurs during this process, an alert message is printed, and the file is skipped.

The function accumulates the structures of all processed files in a dictionary, `repo_structure`, mapping file names to their respective structures. This dictionary represents the overall structure of the repository, excluding ignored files and those specified in `jump_files`.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the `.gitignore` file is located at the root of the repository and that the repository path is correctly set in the `FileHandler` instance.
- Files in `jump_files` are completely excluded from the analysis, as if they do not exist in the repository.
- The function prints messages to the console to indicate files that are being ignored or skipped, providing feedback on the processing status.

**Output Example**:
An example return value of the `generate_overall_structure` function could be a dictionary where each key is a file name (not ignored and not in `jump_files`) and each value is the file's structure as generated by `generate_file_structure`:
```python
{
    "src/main.py": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "name": "main",
            "start_line": 1,
            "end_line": 10,
            "params": ["args"],
            "code_content": "def main(args):\n    print(args)",
            "parent": None
        }
    ],
    "src/utils.py": [
        {
            "type": "class",
            "name": "Helper",
            "start_line": 1,
            "end_line": 20,
            "params": [],
            "code_content": "class Helper:\n    def assist(self):\n        pass",
            "parent": None
        }
    ]
}
```
This output indicates that the repository contains two files, `src/main.py` and `src/utils.py`, not ignored by `.gitignore` or listed in `jump_files`, and provides a detailed structure of their contents.
***
### FunctionDef convert_to_markdown_file(self, file_path)
**convert_to_markdown_file**: The function of `convert_to_markdown_file` is to convert the content of a specified file into markdown format based on the project's hierarchical structure stored in a JSON file.

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (str, optional): The relative path of the file to be converted. If not provided, a default file path set within the object will be used.

**Code Description**:
The `convert_to_markdown_file` function begins by reading the project hierarchy from a JSON file specified by the `project_hierarchy` attribute of the `FileHandler` object. It then checks if a `file_path` is provided; if not, it uses a default path stored in the `FileHandler` object.

The function searches the JSON data for the specified `file_path`. If the file path does not exist in the JSON data, it raises a `ValueError`, indicating the absence of the file object in `project_hierarchy.json`.

For the found file object, the function iterates through its contents, which are expected to be structured data representing different code objects (like functions, classes, etc.) within the file. It sorts these objects by their starting line number to maintain their order as in the source file.

The function then generates markdown content by iterating over each object. It determines the nesting level of each object based on its parent-child relationships, represented in the JSON data, to format the markdown correctly with appropriate heading levels. Special markdown separators are added between top-level objects for better readability.

The markdown content for each object includes its type (e.g., function, class), name, and parameters if applicable, followed by custom markdown content stored in the `md_content` field of each object.

This function is integral to the project's documentation process, as seen in its usage within the `Runner` class methods `add_new_item` and `process_file_changes`. In both cases, after updating the project's JSON structure to reflect changes or additions, `convert_to_markdown_file` is called to generate updated markdown documentation for the affected file. This documentation is then written to a markdown file, ensuring that the project's documentation stays in sync with its codebase.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the JSON data structure correctly represents the project's file hierarchy and that each code object within the file has been accurately captured in this structure.
- The function's ability to generate accurate markdown documentation depends on the completeness and correctness of the `md_content` field for each code object in the JSON data.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the JSON data contains information about a Python file with two functions, `func_a` and `func_b`, where `func_a` is the parent of `func_b`, the output might look like this:

```
# Function func_a():
This function does something.

***
## Function func_b():
This function does something else.
***
```

This example demonstrates the markdown content with headings indicating the object types and names, followed by their descriptions, and separated by markdown separators for readability.
