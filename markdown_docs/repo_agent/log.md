## ClassDef InterceptHandler
**InterceptHandler**: The function of InterceptHandler is to intercept log messages from the standard Python logging module and redirect them to the Loguru logger.

**Attributes**: This class does not explicitly define custom attributes; it inherits attributes from the logging.Handler class.

**Code Description**: The InterceptHandler class is a custom logging handler designed to integrate the standard Python logging module with the Loguru logging library. This integration is crucial for projects that wish to leverage Loguru's advanced logging capabilities while maintaining compatibility with libraries and modules that use the standard logging module.

The class overrides the `emit` method of the logging.Handler class. The `emit` method is called whenever a log message is emitted by the standard logging module. The method performs the following operations:

1. **Level Conversion**: It attempts to map the log level from the standard logging module (e.g., INFO, WARNING) to the corresponding Loguru level. If the mapping fails (e.g., due to an invalid level name), it defaults to using the numeric log level.

2. **Caller Identification**: The method identifies the caller's frame, i.e., the part of the code where the log message originated. This is necessary because Loguru supports automatic capturing of the caller's information, enhancing the log message with contextual details. The identification process involves traversing the call stack until it finds a frame outside of the standard logging module's file. This ensures that the log message accurately reflects the original source of the log call, rather than the InterceptHandler itself.

3. **Logging to Loguru**: Finally, the method logs the message to Loguru, using the determined log level and including any exception information (`exc_info`) if present. It specifies the depth in the call stack to ensure Loguru captures the correct caller information.

The integration with Loguru is facilitated through the `set_logger_level_from_config` function, which configures the logging system at runtime. This function sets the log level based on a configuration, adds the InterceptHandler to the basicConfig of the standard logging module, and ensures that all standard logging messages are intercepted and redirected to Loguru. This approach allows developers to benefit from Loguru's enhanced logging features, such as rich formatting and better exception handling, without modifying existing logging calls throughout their codebase.

**Note**: When using InterceptHandler, it is important to ensure that Loguru is properly configured before intercepting log messages. This includes setting the appropriate log level and log targets (e.g., files, standard error). Failure to do so may result in lost log messages or unexpected logging behavior. Additionally, developers should be aware of the performance implications of traversing the call stack to identify the caller's frame, especially in applications with high logging volume.
### FunctionDef emit(self, record)
**emit**: The function of emit is to log messages using the Loguru logger with the appropriate logging level and caller information.

**Parameters**:
- `self`: Represents the instance of the `InterceptHandler` class.
- `record`: An object containing all the information pertinent to the event being logged.

**Code Description**:
The `emit` function is designed to integrate Python's standard logging module with the Loguru logging library. It performs this integration by intercepting log messages that are emitted by the standard logging handlers and then redirecting these messages to be logged by Loguru instead, ensuring that the log messages retain their original logging level and source information.

1. The function starts by attempting to map the log level from the `record` (provided by the standard logging module) to the corresponding Loguru log level. This is necessary because Loguru might use different names or levels for logging. If the mapping is successful, the Loguru level name is used; otherwise, the numeric level from the `record` is used.

2. It then proceeds to find the caller's information. This is important for debugging purposes, as it allows the log messages to include information about where in the code the log call originated. The function iterates through the call stack using `logging.currentframe()` and skips frames that belong to the logging module itself. This is done to find the frame where the log message was generated, ensuring that the log message accurately reflects the source of the log call.

3. Finally, the function logs the message to Loguru, using the determined log level and the message from the `record`. It also passes the `depth` parameter to Loguru's `opt` method, which helps Loguru in correctly identifying the call site of the log message. If the `record` contains exception information (`exc_info`), it is also passed to Loguru, allowing the logging library to handle and display exceptions appropriately.

**Note**:
- This function is a critical component for applications that wish to leverage the advanced logging capabilities of Loguru while maintaining compatibility with Python's standard logging framework.
- Understanding the mapping between standard logging levels and Loguru's levels is essential for correctly interpreting the log messages.
- The accurate determination of the call site (`depth` calculation) is crucial for meaningful log messages, especially when diagnosing issues in complex applications.

## FunctionDef set_logger_level_from_config
**set_logger_level_from_config**: The function of set_logger_level_from_config is to configure the logging level based on a predefined configuration and ensure that all log messages, including those from the standard Python logging module, are handled by Loguru.

**Parameters**: This function does not accept any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `set_logger_level_from_config` function is designed to initialize and configure the logging system for an application, specifically tailoring it to use the Loguru library for logging purposes. The function performs several key operations as follows:

1. **Configuration Retrieval**: It begins by retrieving the desired log level from a configuration source, identified by the `CONFIG` dictionary with a default value of "INFO" if not specified. This allows for dynamic adjustment of the log level without altering the codebase, facilitating easier debugging and logging control.

2. **Logger Reconfiguration**: The function then proceeds to remove any existing handlers attached to the Loguru logger to prevent duplicate logging. It adds a new handler that directs log messages to `sys.stderr`, with the log level set according to the retrieved configuration. This ensures that all log messages are output to the standard error stream, making them easily visible and separable from standard output.

3. **Standard Logging Interception**: To integrate the standard Python logging module with Loguru, the function employs an `InterceptHandler`. This custom handler is added to the `basicConfig` of the standard logging module, with a log level of 0 (which corresponds to `NOTSET`, ensuring that all messages regardless of level are captured) and `force=True` to override any existing configurations. This handler intercepts log messages from the standard logging system and redirects them to Loguru, leveraging its advanced formatting and handling capabilities.

4. **Success and Error Handling**: Upon successful configuration, the function logs a success message indicating the set log level. If an invalid log level is specified in the configuration, resulting in a `ValueError`, a warning is logged indicating the use of the default log level instead.

The relationship with its callees, particularly the `InterceptHandler`, is crucial for achieving seamless integration between the standard logging module and Loguru. The `InterceptHandler` plays a pivotal role by capturing log messages from the standard logging system and redirecting them to Loguru, thus centralizing log management and enhancing the logging capabilities available to the application.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `CONFIG` dictionary is properly initialized and accessible before calling this function to avoid errors due to undefined configuration. Additionally, since this function configures global logging behavior, it should be called at the application's startup before any logging occurs to ensure consistent logging behavior throughout the application's lifecycle.
